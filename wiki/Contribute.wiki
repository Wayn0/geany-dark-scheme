==Creating and Installing Geany themes==
===Short version===
Extract and copy files to ~/.geany/filedefs directory.

===Long version===
Instructions for creating and installing Geany schemes can be found here:
[http://www.geany.org/manual/0.14/index.html#filetype-definition-files]

The simplest way to create a filedef for a new language is to copy an existing one from the default install and change the colours.
